### Acceptance Criteria
- Default meal plan system page is accessible via "http://localhost"

### Acceptance Criteria
- A Welcome page is correctly displayed when accessing "http://dev.catering4schools.local"

## User Story 4

### Acceptance Criteria

## User Story 5
*As a catering IT specialist, I want to use Docker Compose to manage our meal plan system development environment, so that I can easily start, stop, and rebuild our system setup.*
